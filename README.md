# ANN-Ground-Motion-Model-for-Europe
This repository contains an artificial neural network ground motion model applicable for earthquakes in Europe and Middle East. It is developed using subsets of the ESM and NGA-West2 databases. The training took place in Python environment using the TensorFlow library. The ANN model can be used for scenario simulations or probabilistic seismic risk assessment.
